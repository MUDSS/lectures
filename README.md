# MUDSS Lecture Materials

This repository contains codes, slides, datasets, and all other resources for lectures of [*Manchester University Data Science Society*](https://www.mudss.co.uk/).

Here at MUDSS, we help students in Manchester build skills in data science and obtain internships and careers through workshops, hackathons and careers events. We adamantly believe that data is the future, whether that be its analysis or the communication of its results.
